# football-analysis-ai
This project leverages **Computer Vision** and **Large Language Models (LLMs) "not complete yet (working on)"** to provide smart, automated analysis of football matches from video footage. It tracks players, ball movement, then uses a language model to summarize and interpret tactical insights in natural language.
## Features
-  Real-time player and ball tracking using video input  
-  Tactical analysis using LLMs   
-  Natural language summaries and query responses  
-  Object detection (players, ball, referee)  
-  Interactive question-answer interface  
-  Easy to adapt to other sports (e.g., basketball)

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- YOLOv12  
- ByteTrack     
- PyTorch
## System Workflow
1. **Input**: Raw football match video  
2. **Computer Vision**: Detects and tracks players and ball  
3. **Data Extraction** 
4. **LLM Processing**: Interprets data, answers questions, generates reports  
5. **Output**: Tactical summaries, statistics, natural language interaction
