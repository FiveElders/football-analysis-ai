# football-analysis-ai
This project leverages **Computer Vision** and **Large Language Models (LLMs) "not complete yet (working on)"** to provide smart, automated analysis of football matches from video footage. It tracks players, ball movement, then uses a language model to summarize and interpret tactical insights in natural language.
